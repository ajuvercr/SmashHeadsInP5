Just a silly game.

# Setup

1. Run npm install
2. Run webpack --config-name webpack.config.js [--watch]
With watch, webpack watches your files for changes, otherwise you will have to run webpack again and again,
no webpack, no run.
2. Run npm run build
3. run npm run make
4. Run you own local webserver, you can do this with $python -m SimpleHTTPServer in ./dist folder (python 2.7)
5. Go to localhost:8000 in your favorite webbrowser
